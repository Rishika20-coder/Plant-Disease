# Plant Disease Classification

This project aims to classify plant diseases using deep learning techniques. The implemented model, built with TensorFlow and Keras, can identify various plant diseases based on images, enabling early detection and treatment.

## Project Overview

- **GitHub Repository:** [Plant Disease Classification](https://github.com/Rishika20-coder/Plant-Disease)

## Features

1. **Image Classification:**
   - Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras libraries for image classification of plant diseases.

2. **Deep Learning Model:**
   - Implements a deep learning model with a focus on accuracy in disease identification.

3. **Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss:**
   - Utilizes the Sparse Categorical Cross-Entropy loss function for multi-class classification.

4. **Adam Optimizer:**
   - Implements the Adam optimizer for efficient model training.

5. **Accuracy:**
   - Achieves an accuracy of 91.2% in identifying various plant diseases from images.

## How to Use
